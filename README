Simple VNC terminal emulator (inspired by VncCommand)

We try to simulate a 'xterm', because we want to support:

	- unicode
	- mouse
	
and xterm seems to be the best solution for that.

some code is inspired by: qemu, VncCommand, xterm, linux kernel, ...

libvncserver
============

LibVNCServer does not suppurt TLS currently. So we staically link to a
patched versions on that library instead of using the debian shared
libraries.

VNC Java Applet (for use in web based applications):
====================================================

We use patched VncViewer files (TigerVNC 1.1.0 sources):

http://www.tigervnc.com/

We sign the applet to make clipboard working.

Note: Newer tigervnc 1.2.0 always use a toplevel window, which
make it basically useless as applet.

I put patches for 1.2.0 to newtigerpatches subdir.

TODO:
=====

Useful sources for terminal emulation:
	
   xterm source: ctlseqs.txt
   http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm
   man 5 terminfo
   infocmp xterm
   man console_codes

Fonts: 

we currently use fonts provided by the debian console-data package:
see /usr/share/consolefonts/*

Only 8x16 fonts are supported

TODO contains a list of unimplemented things.
